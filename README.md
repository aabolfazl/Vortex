# Vortex (under development 🏗️)
I had been searching for a project idea that would allow me to delve deeply into Linux Networking and C++ concurrency programming. After evaluating several popular project concepts, I chose to develop a load-balancing web server.

This project is designed to efficiently manage incoming requests, directing traffic to the appropriate origin backend servers. It then collects the responses from these servers and delivers them back to the clients. This system optimizes resource utilization by distributing the workload across multiple servers and ensures high availability and reliability of the service by managing traffic flows intelligently.
